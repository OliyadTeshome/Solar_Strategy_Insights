# Solar_Strategy_Insights

## Strategic Analysis of Solar Infrastructure in West Africa

This project analyzes solar energy infrastructure and production data in **Benin**, **Sierra Leone**, and **Togo** to uncover actionable insights for decision-makers. The goal is to support investment, optimization, and expansion of renewable energy solutions in under-served regions.

## ðŸ§ª Data Sources

The datasets cover:
- **Solar installation performance** (production, uptime, maintenance)
- **Demographic and geographic context**
- **Weather and climate impact**
- **Operational metrics** from mini-grid or off-grid systems

> Note: Due to confidentiality or project scope, raw data might not be public.

## Key Analyses

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** by country
- **Comparison of solar performance across regions**
- **Identification of outliers or anomalies**
- **Correlation of energy output with weather and maintenance events**
- **Policy and investment recommendations**

---

## Key Insights (Preliminary)

- Togo's solar systems show higher uptime but uneven distribution.
- Sierra Leone struggles with maintenance gaps and inconsistent output.
- Benin shows strong potential if rural access is expanded.
